# starling-bank-scripts

This repo contains a selection of scripts I use to manage my Starling Bank bank account.

## balance.py

A small python script to balance money in an account.

This essentially allows you to set your daily withdrawl limit to a value and the rest of the money will be moved into a pot.

Thinking this could allow for additional functionality - such as doing something to increase the limit.
